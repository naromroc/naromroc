- 👋 Hi, I’m @naromroc
- 👀 I’m interested in vague things like games, sports, math, computer science. I'm actually working on how to get more precise about what I like.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to teach efficiently. Being a teacher is not an easy task ^^'
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate
- 📫 How to reach me... well, if you search me you're almost sure to find me. Just give it a try ;)
